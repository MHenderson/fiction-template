other than the pdf. The cleanall target removes the PDF file
as well.
    
    $ make clean

### Live reload

There is a watch target for updating the PDF after any changes
to the TeX source.

    $ make watch

### Configuring hooks

gitinfo2 provides macros that are used in the front matter.
To initialise these hooks run:

    $ make hooks

### Building the PDF
